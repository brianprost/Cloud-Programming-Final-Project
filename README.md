# Homework 4
## Brian Prost

Further exploration of AWS Services, specifically DynamoDB, S3 buckets, Serverless Computing with AWS Lambda, and using REST API with AWS.

Outside of the project constraints, I'm exploring Python features such as modularity and lambda functions.

If there are errors importing OpenCV, please try or verify that it has been installed as a system package instead of just a python package.

For instance, on CentOS, which is was what I used for development of this project, run:

`sudo yum install opencv opencv-devel opencv-python`
